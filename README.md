# MasterMind

## Description
Master Mind is a game of wits and logic where you are required to find out the secret sequence of colors generated randomly each time.

## Rules
- Select 5 colors from the available palette. You can choose colors more than once.
- After each guess, you will receive an N or B :
    - N indicates a color that is correct and in the right position.
    - B indicates a color that is correct but in the wrong position.
    - No feedback means that none of the guessed colors are part of the sequence.
- If you dont manage to guess the correct palette after 12 tries, its game over.
